              “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be
              hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
              but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all who are in the
              house." Happy Birthday to this person whom I just cant even
              describe in words of how much she means to me 😍😍!! Shirley, I
              still remember the first time we ever met where I was cracking a
              stupid joke and you were seeing me, I thought you found how much
              cracked I am and you caught my mind voice and said "Kavalapadatha
              naan edhume kekala" and for a moment I felt ' pah how quiet is
              this girl ' and it turned out to be extremely diff scenario the
              next day... and I really loved your vibe!!!🤩🤩 You always
              included me in everything and you were cheering for me!! Then the
              next deepest moment I had with you was when I won you rejoiced
              like your victory... no one would genuinely have that feeling...
              You rejoiced for me and I was taken aback cuz Ive seen very very
              ppl like u and Vero are the only ones who took joy in my
              victory...and I remember you were talking so proud of me to
              everyone....your joy kept staying in my eyes until the next
              day...I was literally seeing you the whole time and telling to
              myself of how genuine true frnd I had... You made me realise of
              how good friend can someone be... after all what I've been through
              I again found joy in growing your bond to the next level through
              office... Both Personally and Professionally, you have been such
              an AMAZING AMAZING frnd with zero ego, zero attitude... That was
